		<h1 class="title">WELCOME TO LIVING ON ONE</h1>
		<p>This theme has been inspired by <a href="http://livingonone.org/" target="_blank">“Living on One Dollar”</a> documentary we watched one night. We were deeply touched and wanted to somehow contribute to the whole project. As theme developers we decided to develop a WordPress theme to help spread the word about it. This theme demo site is built using real content that we hope will raise the awareness about the problems in Peña Blanca and spread the word about this great documentary. We would like to thank the Living on One team for allowing us to use real photos (for the website presentation) and info from their website. </p>
